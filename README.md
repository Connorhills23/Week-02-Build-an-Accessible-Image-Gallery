# Week-02-Build-an-Accessible-Image-Gallery

i have created a slider for the gallery 

have some thumbnails at the bottom and they do highlight as u hover over them

you can click on the thumbnails and they will show up bigger 
you can use the arrows on each side left and right to go though the images

i have tryed to sort out the screen for the iphone 12 pro and i think i got it not sure 

the buttons go below the thumbnail and still can use the full page
